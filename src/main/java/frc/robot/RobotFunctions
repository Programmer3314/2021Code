TODOs

Lag - Probably in commented code
Ball 2 misses - check belt speed
No need for Gyro 0
Hood up only vibrates prior to shoot sequence 
Lines on Driver Cam for alignment with lower target and other stuff
Eject the Intake and yank it back in.
- DONE - Fix three ball auto that drives back
Make forward not negative
Create firing solution class to pass into shootAll

Logging
Image capture on pi's 


Please init ratchet to engaged position in auto init and teleop init. 
Please add timer (count cycles) and turn on vertical lights/rumble driver with 40 seconds left in match
Please create ThreeBallAuto that drives back.
Please read other todo's in "problems" screen.

- DONE - Fix Target Align Button - probably fixed, must test
- DONE - Take in 5th Ball Sitting on Indexer - maybe fixed, must test
- DONE - Shooter not spinning down after timer - hopefully fixed, must test
- DONE - Climber stopping by itself - not sure why... I made other changes though
- DONE - Init isForward and driverCamNum in both auto and periodic init - done, please check
- DONE - >>>Please add a shooter abort, I don't see one. 





***Actions***
Control Panel | revolutions 3 - 5 | color sensor | Camera
Climb | mini SIM | enocder and switch || 2 switches | 2 Lasers - Bar is level when it breaks both Sensors
shooter | control convey belt | motor brush | motor controller | encoder | 
ball Queuing | mini sim | 


***Motors & Encoders***
1 Bag Motors | Turn Table  - Rotate Hood | Vera planetary encoder
4 Falcons | Drive Train
2 Neos | Shooter
1 Mini Sim | Brushed Motor | Intake
1/2 Motor | Intake Track
1 Mini Sim | Move on Climber Bar
1 Bag Motor | Control Panel | 
1 <= ??? motor(s) | Queuing Balls

***Sensors***
>= 2 Pairs of Sensors | Queuing Balls | 1 before the Shooter | A few more along the tracking

Analog Sensors: We have 8 total, but there might be a problem with 1 (due to NAVX)
We need to manage this list as we move forward. hopefully we'll be able to move the 
ball sensors to digital inputs. 
0 - Front Right Ultrasonic - trench alignment
1 - Floor Ultrasonic sensor - distance to ground
2 - Ball Sensor for intake - Should be digital
3 - Ball Sensor for queuing - Should be digital
4 - Ball Sensor for queuing - Should be digital
5 - Ball Sensor for queuing - Should be digital
6 - Ball Sensor for queuing - Should be digital
7 - Lookup sensor to detect going under Control panel

***Pneumatics***
1 Small Piston | Control Panel Manipulator

*****Ball Intake*****
Mini SIM

*****Ball Queuing*****
????? Motors = using Conveyor belt to move balls in robot

***Driving Mode***
    {Motor Encoder, Gamepad Arcade Style,}
    Chase ball{Camera turn by vision, forward from human control}
    Drive along trench{Driver controlled speed, ultrasonic sensor, gyro, color sensor, Balls in auto, camera to get angle of trench line on side}
    Target to high target tape{Camera to align with center of tape}
    Align to climb{Gyro to be perpindicular to bar}
    Line up from Control Panel{Weight sensor to detect when hood rips off and back up 2 feet}

***Other Things***
    Pickup ball{Sensor for where the ball is in the intake, Motor ecoder, }
    Shoot{Adjust hood, Adjust motor speed (range) 
    Sensors{Motor Encoder, Prox. Sensor(s) for up and down pos}}
    Climb{Motor Encoder, Index of climber, Sensor for bar Leveling, Sensor for off ground}
    Manage queueing balls (to shooter)
    Spin Control Panel{Sensor for position of spinner motor, Motor Encoder, Color sensor(s), Camera?,  }
    Move along climbing bar
    Control shooter hood
    Driver camera Control{Switching camera, Draw on camera that is chosen }
    

Tasks:

-Clean up TODOs - They show up in the "Problems window" below.
-Clean up Warnings
-There are a bunch of is... variables set based on which chassis the code is running on.
But these variables are not fully used. For example, isShooter is set, but the shooter 
update is commented out. On the other hand, the controlPanel "new" statement is conditioned
but the .update isn't. Please fix all of these. You may also want to change the boolean names 
to has... - if(hasShooter)... 
-Gyro Drive: rotate to specified angle (most often 0 degrees), and let the driver control speed. 
This is meant to be used to drive the trench. 
-Gyro Distance Drive: rotate to specified angle and drive for a specified distance. 
This is meant for autonomous.
